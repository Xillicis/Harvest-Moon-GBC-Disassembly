# Harvest Moon GBC

This is a disassembly of Harvest Moon GBC. 
Currently, I (Xillicis) am the only one doing the disassembly, so it takes some time.
The goal is to have a completely reverse engineered game so people can make hacks, translations, etc...

It builds the following rom:

* Harvest Moon GBC (U) [C][!].gb `md5: 498c0a50a5e5cde16127617a97ad6162` 

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
